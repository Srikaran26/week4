## Overview

This week introduced important tools and techniques for handling key-value data, persistent storage using files, and performing efficient data transformations using the Java Stream API.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Map Interface - HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
- Storing key-value pairs
- Ordering and sorting maps
- Custom key comparators

### Day 2: File Input and Output
- Reading and writing text files using `FileReader` and `FileWriter`
- Buffered I/O for efficiency

### Day 3: Serialization and Deserialization
- Saving objects to files
- Restoring objects using `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`

### Day 4: Java Streams Introduction
- Streams vs. Collections
- Lazy vs. eager evaluation

### Day 5: Stream Operations (Filter, Map, Reduce)
- Functional interfaces
- Processing collections with streams

### Day 6: Working with Files using Streams
- Reading CSV and text files using streams
- Collecting and grouping data

## Prerequisites
- Core Java, Collections, and Exception handling (Weeks 1–3)
- JDK and IDE setup

## How to Use This Repository
Each day’s folder contains focused examples and practice programs. Experiment with file I/O and streams using the provided templates.
